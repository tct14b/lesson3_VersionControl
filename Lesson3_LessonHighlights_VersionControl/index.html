            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that saves your files continuously as you work on them. By doing this, you have access to any previous version of the file you are working on. It also will allow you to go to back any one of those previous states if you want to. It also helps identify any problems there might be in a code. It shows you when, who, and where an error in the code would be so it can be easily fixed. Version control is especially helpful for projects that are being worked on by multiple different people. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The most common type of version control is Local Version Control. The reason it is the most common way is because of how simple it is. The down side is that you can easily make mistakes by forgetting which directory you are saving files to. Centralized Version Control Systems were made so that groups of people working on a project could collaborate better. The downside is that all the information for the project is on one machine, if it goes down, nobody can do anything. To counteract the downsides of the previous VCS’, a Distributed Version Control System was created in which all clients had the full repository are their disposal on a remote server. One example of this is Github. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">What is Github</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Github is a Distributed Version Control System. GIthub is different from other VCS’ because unlike the others who think of storing information as changes on a file, Github thinks of the information as snapshots that are taken on a series of files (even though it is dealing with just one file). Github only needs local files to operate, so you can use just your one computer. When using Github, data is only added to your files, which is what makes it so easy to go back to previous “snapshots” of your file if you need to.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Github has three stats where files are located: committed, modified, and staged. When files are in the committed state, they are saved in your local database. When in the modified state, files have been changed, but not yet committed to your database. In the staged state, files have marked a modified file that is ready to be your next snapshot. The directory is where all the metadata for your project is stored. The directory is used when you want to copy the repository from one computer to another. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Github Backstory</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> Github started with the Linux kernel, an open source software project that anybody can use and edit the code and then share that code. Thus, BitKeeper was made from the kernel. BitKeeper was a Disturbed Version Control System. However, something happened where the people that developed the Linux kernel and the people that developed BitKeeper caused the Distributed Version Control System to break down and it was no longer free. So the creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds, used the basic code he saw in BitKeeper to create a new DVCS and Github was born.</p>
